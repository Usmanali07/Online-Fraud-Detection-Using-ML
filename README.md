# Online-Fraud-Detection-Using-ML
# Develop-Online-Payments-Fraud-Detection-system-using-Artificial-Intelligence
Online Payment is happened, when customers buy something (clothes, shoes) using credit card etc. Online payment systems decrease workload of customers. In online payment system, fraud detection is major challenge, therefore, it is important to develop system to detect fraud customer in advance. The proposed system will detect fraud Customer in advance using Machine Learning techniques.  In this project, students will find appropriate machine learning techniques on Synthetic Financial Datasets for Fraud Detection. 
Functional Requirements:
Students will perform all these tasks.
1.	Data-Collection 
 In this project, students will detect fraud customer behavior ("isFraud") using input features ("type", "amount", "oldbalanceOrg", "newbalanceOrig"). The dataset is already available on Kaggle website. 
2.	Data-Preparation 
After collecting the data, you need to transform the dataset in machine learning acceptable format, therefore you will perform different preprocessing steps,

3.	Pre-processing 
In pre-processing, first, you will handle missing value, Second, to covert categorical data into numeric form, you will perform hot encoding technique, third, you will normalize data by apply z-score technique. 
4.	Feature Selection 
To select best features, you will apply the feature selection method.
5.	Train & Test Data 
Dataset will be split into ratio 70% training & 30% testing data sets.
6.	Machine learning Techniques 
 In this project, you will apply machine learning techniques (e.g. Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree etc.) to predict fraud customer with high accuracy. 

7.	Confusion Matrix 
To check the performance of ML models, confusion matrix table will be created using python library.
8. Performance metric  
Accuracy, precision and F1- score will be used to evaluate the performance of ML models of this projects
 
Tools: 
•	Python (programming language) 
•	Colab
•	Machine learning
